This package is part of my DS 5010 Final Project. In this package contains implementations of creating linear regressions using both the gradient descent and linear algebra methods.
The purpose of the package is to fit regressions for the purpose of causal inference analysis. Features of the package include:
* hypothesis testing for significance of coefficients
* basic model information
* correlation measuring
* 2d plotting
* basic feature engineering relevant to regression fitting

I will soon include implementations for 2SLS IV regression and difference in difference regression
